# SMS Spam Detector ðŸ“±

A simple machine learning project to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using **Naive Bayes** and the **Bag-of-Words** model.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Loads and preprocesses the classic SMS Spam Collection dataset.
* Converts text messages into numerical features using **CountVectorizer**.
* Trains a **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)** classifier.
* Evaluates the model with **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**.
* Allows users to test custom messages interactively.
